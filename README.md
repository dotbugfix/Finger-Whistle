Finger-Whistle
==============
An Android app that displays a chioce of whistles in a carousel and plays them through the phone speaker. The available whistles are:
-Guy's Whistle
-Gals' Whistle
-Flirt whistle
-Dog Whistle

The app also allows the user to send feedback and 'request for a whistle' by sending an Email to the developer.

Android Market Link
===================
TBD

Showcase
========
I usually have a 'showcase' page to show off the project from an end-user's perspective on my website.
This should be coming soon!

DEVELOPMENT TOOLS
=================
Uses the Apache Cordova (formerly Phonegap) library to make a webapp. All source code is thus in the /assets/www folder.
Uses the Sencha Touch 2 library to develop the GUI. The app implements the MVC framework supported by Sencha Touch 2.

SOURCE CODE TAKEAWAY
====================
In the spirit of Open-Source, all 'source' is released here. Since the app is intended to be available on the Android Markket (and possibly other app markets too, since Cordova allows it to be cross-platform), proprietary content, such as images and media are not included.
This project demonstrates the use of various Sencha Touch 2 components and showcases the MVC framework as supported by Sencha Touch 2.

Since the app released on the Android market is built using the cloud build feature of Cordova, the JAR included here will remain v1.9.0 and will not be updated. Rest assured, since the project is built locally too for testing, any Cordova features used in the project should be supported by the included library.
